# Swin Transformer for Product Image Classification
### Gregoris Georgiou, Kyriakos Kyriakou, Alessandro Speggiorin

## Overview

This research explores the use of pre-trained Shifted Window Transformers (Swin) for accurate product image classification. We aim to address challenges in this domain by fine-tuning Swin Transformers on limited data from the Product-10k dataset. Our approach, which includes data augmentation, L2 regularization, label smoothing, and Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) optimizer, achieves a total accuracy of 89.3%.

## Key Findings

- Swin Transformers, with our techniques, show strong generalization capabilities for product image classification.
- Our approach reduces the need for costly manual annotation, making it a resource-effective solution.
- Data augmentation, L2 regularization, label smoothing, and SAM optimizer improve model performance.
